# PROBLEM:

# Given a string, write a method change_me which returns the same
# string but with all the words in it that are palindromes uppercased.

# change_me("We will meet at noon") == "We will meet at NOON"
# change_me("No palindromes here") == "No palindromes here"
# change_me("") == ""
# change_me("I LOVE my mom and dad equally") == "I LOVE my MOM and DAD equally"

def change_me(string)
  array = string.split(' ')
  counter = 0

  array.each do |word|
    if word == word.reverse
      word.upcase!
    end
  end
  
  string = array.join(' ')
  string
end

p change_me("We will meet at noon") == "We will meet at NOON"
p change_me("No palindromes here") == "No palindromes here"
p change_me("") == ""
p change_me("I LOVE my mom and dad equally") == "I LOVE my MOM and DAD equally"
